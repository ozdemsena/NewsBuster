 NewsBuster is a machine learning project designed to detect and classify news articles as real or fake.
Using TF-IDF text vectorization and multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Linear SVM, and MLP), the system evaluates the authenticity of news content with detailed performance reports.
📰 News Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data (removing stopwords, punctuation, URLs).

🧮 TF-IDF Feature Extraction: Transforming raw text into numerical features.

🤖 Multi-Model Training: Benchmarking different ML models for fake news detection.

📊 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve.

💾 Model Saving: Pre-trained models and vectorizers ready for deployment.

⚡ Prediction Function: Quick fake/real prediction for any given news article.
## Dataset

This project uses the **Fake and Real News Dataset** from Kaggle:  
[Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

- `Fake.csv` : Contains fake news articles.  
- `True.csv` : Contains real news articles.  

This repo can serve as both a learning resource for NLP beginners and a baseline system for advanced fake news detection research.
